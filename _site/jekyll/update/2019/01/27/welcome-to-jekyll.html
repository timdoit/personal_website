<meta name="description" content="This morning I joined the 5AM club. I am trying to implement the “holy hour” concept by committing the first hour of my day to myself. Completely disconnected from the world and to spend that time preparing for the day mentally. I spent the first 20 minutes of my day focusing on movement and readying my body for the day. The next 20 minutes were focused on reflection. Writing in my journal and asking myself the big question. I spent time thinking about my goals and the why? behind them. The last 20 minutes of the holy hour is spent reading. I’m reading the book Millionaire SUCCESS Habits: The Gateway to Wealth &amp; Prosperity by Dean Graziosi. I’m loving it so far and starting the day reading books that prepare the mind for success is key." />
